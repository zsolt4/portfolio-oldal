## Hello my friend. :

First of all, I would like to welcome you to my resume or portfolio site. Couldn't say this is my first website, because this is my second tour in the world of internet.
Couple of years ago i was working in different projects like building websites, networking,  and so on but at the and I needed to leave all because of changes in other sides of my life.
After 8 years of being totally offline, now I'm trying to come back. 





You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zsolt4/portfolio-oldal/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zsolt4/portfolio-oldal/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
