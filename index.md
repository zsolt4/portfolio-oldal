# Hello my friend 

First of all,  you are welcome here at my resume or portfolio site. Couldn't say this is my first website, because this is my second tour in the world of internet.
Couple of years ago i was working in different projects like building websites, networking,  and so on but at the and I needed to leave all because of changes in other sides of my life.
After 8 years of being totally offline, now I'm trying to come back. 

I am building this site to have a documentation about my way back to the online world. 

I don't promisse but really hope I will link here all of my project on which I'm working.
